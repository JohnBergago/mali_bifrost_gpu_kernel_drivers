The Android and Linux version of the Mali GPUs Device Driver provide low-level access to the Mali-G71 GPU.

Some of these components are being made available under the GPLv2 licence. This page provides access to the source packages from which loadable kernel modules can be built.

Note that these components are not a complete driver stack. To build a functional OpenGL ES you need access to the full source code of the Mali GPU DDK, which is provided under the standard Arm commercial licence to all Mali GPU customers.

The open source drivers provided on this page are designed to run with a version-compatible release of the Mali GPU DDK. In functional and performance terms they are identical to the implementations provided under the commercial licence. By also releasing them under the GPLv2 licence we hope to make it easier to include Mali GPU drivers on any Linux or Android platform.
